         <h2 id="head">INTRODUCTION :</h2>
         <P id="des">Information Communication Technology (ICT) encompasses a 
            wide range of technologies used to handle telecommunications,
             broadcasting media, intelligent building management systems,
              audiovisual processing and transmission systems, and network-based 
              control and monitoring functions. It involves both computer hardware
               and software that facilitate the processing, storage, retrieval, and 
               communication of information. By integrating ICT into education,
                it significantly enhances the teaching and learning experience,
                 providing access to vast resources and interactive tools.</P>
        <ul id="appli">
            <li><h3>E-learning Platforms:</h3> ICT enables the creation of online courses and resources accessible from anywhere, promoting distance learning and lifelong learning</li>
            <li><h3>Interactive Whiteboards: </h3>These devices enhance traditional teaching methods with digital content and interactive features, making learning more engaging.</li>
            <li><h3>Virtual Classrooms:</h3>ICT facilitates real-time communication between teachers and students, regardless of their physical location, promoting inclusivity and access to education.</li>
            <li><h3>Digital Libraries :</h3> Online libraries provide vast resources, including e-books, journals, and databases, accessible at any time, supporting research and learning</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="pros">
